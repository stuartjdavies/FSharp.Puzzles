# Puzzle 1 – Linked list

Write a function that would return the 5th element from the tail (or end) of a singly linked list of integers.
For example, given the list 2 -> 3 -> 4 ->5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 10 -> 11 your function would return 7.

Your code:
* Should return the 5th element from the tail in a single pass.
* Should be your own code and should not use any built-in .NET collection components.
