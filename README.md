## Overview
This github repository contains a list of puzzles solved in FSharp

## Puzzle 1 – Linked list

Write a function that would return the 5th element from the tail (or end) of a singly linked list of integers.
For example, given the list 2 -> 3 -> 4 ->5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 10 -> 11 your function would return 7.

Your code:
* Should return the 5th element from the tail in a single pass.
* Should be your own code and should not use any built-in .NET collection components.

## Puzzle 2 - Triangles

Write a function that receives three integer inputs for the lengths of the sides of a triangle and returns one of four values to determine the triangle type.

1. Scalene
2. Isosceles
3. Equilateral
4. Error

### Triangles

1. Equilateral - Three equal sides
2. Isosceles - Two equal sides
3. Scalene - No equal sides

## Puzzle 3 – Reverse Words

Write a function to reverse the words in a string, for example “cat and dog” becomes “tac dna god”.
Please do not use any string manipulation functions that you do not implement yourself.

## Puzzle 4 - Is it Possible

## Puzzle 5 - Closest Numbers

### Problem Statement

Sorting is often useful as the first step in many different tasks. The most common task is to make finding things easier, but there are other uses, as well.

### Challenge 
Given a list of unsorted integers, A={a1,a2,…,aN}, can you find the pair of elements that have the smallest absolute difference between them? If there are multiple pairs, find them all.

### Input Format 
The first line of input contains a single integer, N, representing the length of array A. 
In the second line, there are N space-separated integers, a1,a2,…,aN, representing the elements of array A.

### Output Format 
Output the pairs of elements with the smallest difference. If there are multiple pairs, output all of them in ascending order, all on the same line (consecutively) with just a single space between each pair of numbers. If there's a number which lies in two pair, print it two times (see the sample case #3 for explanation).

### Constraints

2 ≤N ≤ 200000
−107≤ai≤107
ai≠aj,where 1≤i<j≤N
