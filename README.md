## Puzzle One – Linked list

Write a function that would return the 5th element from the tail (or end) of a singly linked list of integers.
For example, given the list 2 -> 3 -> 4 ->5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 10 -> 11 your function would return 7.

Your code:
* Should return the 5th element from the tail in a single pass.
* Should be your own code and should not use any built-in .NET collection components.

## Puzzle Two - Triangles

1. Scalene
2. Isosceles
3. Equilateral
4. Error

### Triangles

1. Equilateral - Three equal sides
2. Isosceles - Two equal sides
3. Scalene - No equal sides
